The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary are:

1. `MLPModel`: This class will define the multi-layer perceptron model. It will have methods for training the model and making predictions.

2. `train_model`: This function will be used to train the `MLPModel` using the provided dataset.

3. `predict_species`: This function will use the trained `MLPModel` to predict the species of a fish based on the provided measurements.

4. `app`: This will be the main Flask application object. It will define the routes for the web app.

5. `index`: This function will handle the main route ("/") of the web app. It will render the main page of the app.

6. `predict`: This function will handle the prediction route ("/predict") of the web app. It will take the user's input, use the `MLPModel` to make a prediction, and return the result.

7. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the application. It will start the Flask server.
